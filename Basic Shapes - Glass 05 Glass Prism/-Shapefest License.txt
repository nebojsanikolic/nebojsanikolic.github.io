SimpleLicense: Licensing Made Easy

We know that getting your head around complex licensing rights can be confusing. So we use a proprietary SimpleLicense - written in plain english - to help you easily understand the license that comes with every download on Shapefest.

The SimpleLicense gives you the right to use any item downloaded or purchased on ShapeFest.com in a personal or commercial project for yourself or a client, but the item cannot be resold or redistributed on its own, or used in a product offered for sale where the item contributes to the core value of the product being sold.


Here’s what the SimpleLicense allows for each item on ShapeFest.com:

√ Personal or commercial use permitted.

√ Both free and paid assets can be used in an unlimited number of design projects for web, mobile, or print.

√ Assets can be used yourself or on behalf of a client.

√ Both paid and free assets can be used in the design of UI kits but cannot function as the primary value proposition of any free or paid UI kit.

√ When used as part of a new work, there’s no limit to the number of copies of the new work that can be distributed.

X Assets cannot be sub-licensed, resold, shared, transferred, or otherwise redistributed on its own (even for free).

X Assets cannot be used in a product offered for sale where the item contributes to the core value of the product being sold.

If you’re still unclear about what is or isn’t allowed under the SimpleLicense, please respect the creator and contact Joseph Angelo Todaro for clarification.
